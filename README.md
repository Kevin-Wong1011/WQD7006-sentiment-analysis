## Comparative Analysis of Text Representation Techniques for Sentiment Classification of Airline Tweets

With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-generated content are produced daily, offering a rich source of textual data for analyzing public sentiment. Sentiment analysis — the computational process of detecting opinions and emotions in text — has become a key application in fields such as business intelligence, market research, and social sciences. A critical step in this process is converting raw text into structured numerical representations that machine learning models can interpret. The choice of text representation method greatly influences the effectiveness of sentiment classification.

This project focuses on evaluating and comparing various text representation techniques using a dataset of airline-related tweets. The methods assessed range from traditional approaches such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF, to more advanced models like N-grams, Word2Vec, and transformer-based embeddings such as Sentence-BERT (SBERT). These features are used to train classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. The study aims to identify which combinations of representation and model deliver the best performance, with additional tuning to further optimize results.
